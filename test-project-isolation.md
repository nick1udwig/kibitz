# Test Project Directory Isolation Fix

## üîß **What Was Fixed**

The issue was that ws-mcp tools were being initialized with the base projects directory (`/Users/test/gitrepo/projects/`) instead of the project-specific directory (`/Users/test/gitrepo/projects/{projectId}_{name}/`).

**Before:** Tools created their own subdirectories in the base path
**After:** Tools work directly in the project-specific directory

## üß™ **Test Commands**

### Test 1: Verify Working Directory
```
Show me my current working directory and list all files in it.
```
**Expected:** Should show `/Users/test/gitrepo/projects/{projectId}_{name}/` and list README.md

### Test 2: Create Files in Correct Location
```
Create a simple JavaScript file called test.js that console.logs "Hello from project {projectName}" and then list the directory contents.
```
**Expected:** File should be created directly in project directory, not in a subdirectory

### Test 3: Multi-File Project Structure
```
Create a simple Node.js project with:
- package.json
- index.js with a simple server
- .gitignore
Then show me the complete directory structure.
```
**Expected:** All files should be in project root, not in nested subdirectories

### Test 4: Verify Git Operations
```
Initialize git, add all files, and commit them. Then show me the git log and current directory.
```
**Expected:** Git should work in the project directory directly

## üéØ **Key Indicators of Success**

1. **Tool calls show correct workspace path:** `any_workspace_path` should be `/Users/test/gitrepo/projects/{projectId}_{name}/`
2. **No extra mkdir commands:** Tools shouldn't create additional subdirectories
3. **Files in correct location:** All created files should be directly in the project directory
4. **Git operations work:** Git should be initialized in the project directory itself

## üîç **Debugging**

If issues persist, check F12 logs for:
- `Initialize` tool calls and their `any_workspace_path` parameter
- `BashCommand` tools and whether they're running `mkdir` commands
- Directory paths in console logs from `ensureProjectDirectory`
