This file was created at 2025-07-16T13:32:07.630566 to test Git initialization.

## Expected Behavior:
1. Git should be initialized in the project directory
2. This file should be detected as a change
3. Auto-commit should create a branch after 3 minutes
4. Branch should be visible in the project

## Fixes Applied:

- Updated rootStore to preserve type field when processing BashCommand
- Fixed both project and non-project context handling

## Test Status:

- Git init: Pending...
- Branch creation: Pending...
