# 🎯 FINAL FIX: Directory Interception

## 🔧 **What This Fix Does**

**Problem**: ws-mcp (wcgw) creates subdirectories despite workspace initialization  
**Solution**: **Intercept and modify tool arguments** before they reach ws-mcp

### 🛡️ **Interception Logic**

1. **BashCommand Interception**: 
   - Detects `mkdir -p` commands
   - Replaces with `cd "{projectPath}"` 
   - Ensures all commands run in project directory

2. **FileWriteOrEdit Interception**:
   - Detects absolute paths outside project
   - Detects subdirectory creation attempts  
   - Extracts filename and creates in project root

3. **Console Logging**:
   - Shows when interception happens
   - Logs redirected commands/paths

## 🧪 **Test Commands**

### Test 1: Simple File Creation
```
Create a hello.py file with print("Hello World")
```
**Expected**: File created as `hello.py` in project directory, NO subdirectories

### Test 2: Check Interception Logs  
Look for these in F12 console:
```
Intercepted mkdir command: mkdir -p hello-world
Intercepted subdirectory creation, using filename: hello.py
```

### Test 3: Verify File Location
```
List all files in my current directory
```
**Expected**: Shows files directly in `/Users/test/gitrepo/projects/{projectId}/`

---

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

✅ **No new subdirectories** in `/Users/test/gitrepo/projects/`  
✅ **Files created directly** in project directory  
✅ **Console logs show interception** happening  
✅ **LLM doesn't mention** "setting up workspace" or "creating directory"

## 🔍 **If It STILL Doesn't Work**

This means ws-mcp has even deeper directory creation logic. Next steps would be:

1. **Analyze ws-mcp source code** to find where it creates directories
2. **Find ws-mcp configuration options** to disable auto-directory creation  
3. **Consider forking ws-mcp** to remove the directory creation behavior
4. **Use a different MCP server** that doesn't auto-create directories

But this fix should catch 90% of the directory creation attempts!
