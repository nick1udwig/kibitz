## Prerequisites

* git
* npm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nick1udwig/kibitz.git
cd kibitz
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Configuration

1. Open the Settings panel in the UI
2. Enter your Anthropic API key ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/)).
3. Optionally set a system prompt
4. Configure MCPs by running them using [ws-mcp](https://github.com/nick1udwig/ws-mcp) and then connecting to them in the Settings page

Note configuration is PER-PROJECT.
When creating a new project, it will use some, but not all, of the current project's configuration: the API key, model, and system prompt will be copied over, but MCP servers will not.

## Building for Kinode

1. Add a base to the endpoint by building with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` (MUST start with a `/`),
2. Change the default WS-MCP server URI by specifying `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_WS_URI` (MUST start with a `/`),

like so:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/kibitz:kibitz:nick.kino NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_WS_URI=/fwd-ws:kibitz:nick.kino npm run build
```

and then copy the contents of `out/` into the package's `pkg/ui/` dir.
