# Auto-Commit Fix Test

This file is being created to test the auto-commit functionality after applying the comprehensive fix.

## Fixes Applied:

1. **Removed `type` field from BashCommand**: Fixed the validation error where MCP server rejected `type: 'BashCommand'`
2. **Added file change tracking**: Now `trackFileChange` is called when `FileWriteOrEdit` is executed
3. **Added pending changes clearing**: After successful auto-commit, `clearPendingChanges` is called
4. **Fixed change detection**: The auto-commit system now properly detects when files are created/modified

## Expected Behavior:

- When this file is created, it should be tracked as a pending change
- The auto-commit should trigger immediately since there's at least 1 pending change
- A new Git commit should be created automatically
- The pending changes should be cleared after successful commit

## Timeline:

- File created: ${new Date().toISOString()}
- Expected auto-commit: Within 3 seconds of file creation
- Expected branch creation: If multiple files are changed

**Test ID**: ${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}
