# üö® URGENT FIX: Workspace Directory Override

## üîß **What We Just Fixed**

**Problem**: ws-mcp was creating new directories for every tool call instead of using the project-specific directory.

**Solution**: Modified `executeTool` to **force workspace initialization** with the project directory before EVERY tool call.

---

## ‚úÖ **Quick Verification Test**

### Step 1: Use the New System Prompt
Copy the content from `kibitz-project-aware-prompt.md` and paste it as your system prompt.

### Step 2: Test with Simple Command
```
Create a hello.c file with a simple "Hello World" program. Do NOT create any directories - just create the file directly.
```

### Step 3: Check F12 Logs
Look for this line in the console:
```
Forced workspace initialization to: /Users/test/gitrepo/projects/{projectId}_{name}
```

### Step 4: Verify No mkdir Commands
The tool calls should NOT contain commands like:
- `mkdir -p hello-world-c`
- `mkdir my-project`
- Any directory creation commands

---

## üéØ **Expected Behavior Now**

‚úÖ **Before each tool call**: Forced initialization with project path  
‚úÖ **File creation**: Direct in project directory (no subdirectories)  
‚úÖ **Working directory**: Always `/Users/test/gitrepo/projects/{projectId}_{name}/`  
‚úÖ **No mkdir commands**: LLM won't create subdirectories  

---

## üîç **If Still Not Working**

If you still see directory creation issues:

1. **Check console logs** for "Forced workspace initialization"
2. **Verify system prompt** is the new one with warnings about directories
3. **Look at Initialize tool calls** - should show correct `any_workspace_path`
4. **Check for mkdir commands** in BashCommand tool calls

---

## üöÄ **Test Commands**

Try these to verify the fix:

```
1. Create a simple Python script called test.py
2. Make a Node.js package.json file  
3. Create a C program that prints hello world
4. List all files in my current directory
```
