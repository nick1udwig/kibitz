# Auto-Commit Test

This is a test file to verify that the auto-commit system is working correctly after fixing the BashCommand schema issues.

## Issues Fixed:

1. **BashCommand Schema Mismatch**: Fixed the issue where BashCommand was being called with both `command` and `action_json` properties
2. **Missing Project Context**: Added fallback for BashCommand processing when there's no project context
3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track BashCommand format issues

## Expected Behavior:

- Auto-commit should trigger after 3 minutes of inactivity
- Git branches should be created automatically
- No more "Additional properties are not allowed" errors

## Test Steps:

1. Create this file
2. Wait for 3 minutes
3. Check browser console for auto-commit logs
4. Verify git branches are created
