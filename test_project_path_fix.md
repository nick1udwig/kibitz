# Project Path Fix Test

This file is being created to test that the project path generation is now working correctly.

## Issue Fixed:

The `projectPath` was showing as empty (`""`) in the logs because:
1. `activeProjectId` was being stored with quotes (`"hq5qbw"` instead of `hq5qbw`)
2. `project.name` was being stored with quotes (`"New Project"` instead of `New Project`)
3. `customPath` was being passed as string `"undefined"` instead of actual `undefined`

## Fixes Applied:

1. **Quote Removal in rootStore**: Added `cleanProjectId` and `cleanProjectName` to remove quotes before calling `getProjectPath`
2. **Quote Removal in getProjectPath**: Added comprehensive quote removal for all input parameters
3. **Better Custom Path Handling**: Fixed the check for `customPath` to properly handle string `"undefined"`

## Expected Behavior:

- The `projectPath` should now be properly generated as `/Users/test/gitrepo/projects/{projectId}_{sanitized-name}`
- Git operations should work correctly with the proper path
- Auto-commit and branch creation should function properly

## Test Details:

- Created: ${new Date().toISOString()}
- Should generate proper project path in logs
- Should trigger auto-commit functionality
- Should enable Git branch creation

**Test Result Expected**: âœ… Project path properly generated, auto-commit working
